# p5-starfield Project

This project creates an interactive starfield effect using the p5.js library. The stars will continuously move and scale based on user interactions, providing a dynamic visual experience.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that loads the p5.js library and the `sketch.js` file, setting up the canvas to display the starfield effect.
- `sketch.js`: The main JavaScript file containing the logic for generating stars, handling movement, scaling, and managing mouse and touch events.
- `README.md`: This file contains project descriptions and usage instructions to help users understand how to run and use the starfield program.

## Getting Started
